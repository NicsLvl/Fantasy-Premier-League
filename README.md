# Introduction
In the beginning, the FPL managers have a budget of 100 pounds to select 15 players (3 FWD, 5 MID, 5 DEF, 2 GK) with a maximum of three players from one club.
The managers can transfer only one player every Gameweek (GW) and select a replacement for someone in the team.
The trickiest part of all the captain selection as the score gets doubled for the captain.

# Team
From your 15 player squad, select 11 players by the Gameweek deadline to form your team.

All your points for the Gameweek will be scored by these 11 players, however if one or more doesn't play they may be automatically substituted.

Your team can play in any formation providing that 1 goalkeeper, at least 3 defenders and at least 1 forward are selected at all times.

From your starting 11 you nominate a captain and a vice-captain. Your captain's score will be doubled.

If your captain plays 0 minutes in the Gameweek, the captain will be changed to the vice-captain.

If both captain and vice-captain play 0 minutes in a Gameweek, then no player's score will be doubled.
