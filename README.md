# Introduction
In the beginning, the FPL managers have a budget of 100 pounds to select 15 players (3 FWD, 5 MID, 5 DEF, 2 GK) with a maximum of three players from one club.
The managers can transfer only one player every Gameweek (GW) and select a replacement for someone in the team.
The trickiest part of all the captain selection as the score gets doubled for the captain.
